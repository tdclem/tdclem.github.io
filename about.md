Tyler is a California based musician and producer releasing music and other content under the handle YetAnotherTyler. He got his start in music through classical guitar instruction which he studied for half a decade. Through this instruction he learned the basics of music theory which he applies to the music he makes today.

Tyler runs a weekly segment called Indie Music Gems, where he shares independantally produced music that you should be listening to. He hopes to shine a light on many underappreciated musicians and producers through this effort.

Tyler's only goal is to make and share music that he loves to listen to.
