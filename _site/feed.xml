        <title>Waterdeep Dragon Heist: Final Thoughts</title>
        <description>
          
          Several months ago, I began my journey as a DM by running Waterdeep Dragon Heist for a group of friends, and last week we finished the adventure. I decided on WDH because I frequently saw it recommended for new DMs or players, and the story seemed straightforward but interesting. While...

        <title>Waterdeep Dragon Heist Recap: Chapter Four</title>
        <description>
          
          Now that my players completed their fireball investigation, and had their sights set on the Stone of Golorr, I was ready to start the final chapter of Waterdeep Dragon Heist. In Chapter Four, players should be chasing after the Stone of Golorr, hunting down the vault keys, and entering the...

        <title>WDH: Running Cassalanter Villa</title>
        <description>
          
          The villain’s lairs make up nearly half of the chapters in Waterdeep Dragon Heist, and they are sadly completely optional. When I ran the adventure, I knew that I wanted to have my players heist the lair of my selected villain, the Cassalanters. Having just ran the villa in my...

        <title>WDH: DMs Guild and Other Resources</title>
        <description>
          
          Waterdeep Dragon Heist has many resources from third parties to help expand on and better run the module, here are some of the ones that I found to be very useful. Sly Flourish: Session Zero Because WDH has a different style when compared to other prewritten adventures, I felt it...

        <title>Waterdeep Dragon Heist Recap: Chapter Three</title>
        <description>
          
          Chapter Three of Waterdeep Dragon Heist begins with a fireball going off in Trollskull Alley, the player’s main goal will be investigating what happened. My main concern with transitioning from the open-ended Chapter Two to the linear Chapter Three was motivating my players to get involved with the investigations, since...

        <description>
          
          These are some quick Dungeondraft battlemaps that I made for the Cassalanter Asmodean Shrine Outpost from The Alexandrian Remix. For these battlemaps the grid size is 256 pixels, feel free to use them as you please! In my campaign, I ran the Cassalanter outpost a bit differently than what was...

        <title>Waterdeep Dragon Heist Recap: Chapter Two</title>
        <description>
          
          Following Chapter One of Waterdeep Dragon Heist, my players had some treasure, and the keys to Trollskull Manor. My focus for Chapter Two of the module was renovating the manor, and completing some faction missions. Overall, we spent five sessions in this chapter, but the module is flexible enough that...

          A few months ago, I began my journey as a DM by deciding to run the prewritten module Waterdeep Dragon Heist. As we now begin to wrap up the campaign, I wanted to start recapping my experience from each chapter in order to document my thoughts, and potentially give some...
