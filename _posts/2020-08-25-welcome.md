Hello my name is Tyler and welcome to my website! I am a California based musician and producer that is working on music and music review content.

This website will be the home for my current weekly series Indie Music Gems, which covers new indie music that you should be listening to. I will also use this website from time to time to share updates on my own musical endevours.

For now you can check out my most recent Spotify release below:
