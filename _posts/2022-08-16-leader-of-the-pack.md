## Leader of the Pack, Now on DMs Guild!
I am excited to share my first supplement on the DMs Guild, [Leader of the Pack!](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/406741/Leader-of-the-Pack){:target="_blank"} While prepping the werewolf den for Curse of Strahd, I was a bit disappointed with the generic statblock for Kiril Stoyanovich. This new statblock makes use of the Mythic Monster rules to represent his transition from a cunning warrior into a savage beast. These changes aim to provide a much more challenging and dramatic fight when compared to the original statblock for Kiril.

If you have been following my posts for awhile now, you may have noticed I used this revised statblock during my Curse of Strahd game, check out my [session twelve recap](https://yetanothertyler.com/2022-07-12-cos-diary-session-12/){:target="_blank"} to read how that went! Thank you all for the support I have recieved so far, I hope you enjoy using this version of Kiril in your games!
