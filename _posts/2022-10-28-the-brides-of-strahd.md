## The Brides of Strahd, Now on DMs Guild!
I am excited to share a new pay what you want supplement for Curse of Strahd on the DMs Guild, [The Brides of Strahd!](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/414884/The-Brides-of-Strahd){:target="_blank"} The supplement aims to provide more challenging and interesting statblocks for the three brides of Strahd. This is done by converting the brides into *Tashaâ€™s Cauldron of Everything* sidekicks, which grants them abilities that aid Strahd in combat. Thank you to everyone who has picked it up already, I hope you enjoy using it in your game!
